                    <p class="top-p">In 1970, Norma McCorvey, also known by the pseudonym “Jane Roe,” was the plaintiff in the case of Roe v. Wade. Roe sought a legal abortion but was denied access as it did not pose any medical risk to her life. Proceeding after Roe filed a lawsuit against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, Texas, challenging a Texas law that made abortions illegal except by a medical professional’s order to save a woman’s life.
                    </p>

                    <p class="top-p"> In 1973, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Roe, determining that the decision of whether or not an individual chose to proceed or terminate a pregnancy was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which covers the privacy of an individual, including the right to abort before fetal viability. Alongside other Constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech, Roe placed reproductive decision-making on high importance and remained consistent with giving insightful perspective on how the right of privacy should protect intimate and personal decisions, such as child-rearing, marriage, procreation, and the use of contraception, from government interference. The ruling in favor of Roe shifted abortion bans to become illegal and provided safer and more reliable resources when seeking abortion care.

                    <h4>The start of a Revolution</h4>
                    <p class="card-p">During the 1960s men were praised for having sex while women were looked down upon for the same acts. While most relationships at the time resulted in pregnancy, women would be left with the responsibility to bare the child and the man would share no same fate. This left Margret Sanger, a pioneer for contraceptives, down a road of advocacy to fight for and spread the accessibility of birth control for all women.

                    <h4>The First Step</h4>
                    <p class="card-p">In 1973, the Supreme Court heard of Jane Roe, an unmarried Texas mother who claimed the state has violated her constitutional rights by banning the practice of abortion. This resulted in a 7-2 vote in favor of Roe, the first victory in the fight for reproductive rights. This decision showed the world that a woman's right to make her own decision about her own pregnancy merits the highest level of constitutional protection.

The green bandanna unifies those who support these rights and highlights ongoing efforts to expand access to reproductive healthcare around the world.
